The amount of waste has been increasing due to the increase in human 
population and urbanization. In cities, the overflowing bin creates an 
unhygienic environment. This degrades the environment, to overcome 
this situation “Automatic Waste Segregator” is developed to reduce work 
for the ragpickers, the waste is segregated by human beings which leads 
to health problems for the workers. The proposed system separates the 
waste into two categories namely wet and dry waste. This developed 
system is not only cost-efficient but also makes waste management 
productive. Each of the wastes is detected by the respective sensors and 
gets segregated inside the bins which are assigned to them.
